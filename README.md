## AI Learning System

### How It Works

The AI learning system operates on multiple levels:

#### 1. Pattern Recognition
- Extracts common coding patterns from your input
- Identifies function names, variable declarations, and method calls
- Tracks frequency of different code structures

#### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline
```
Code Input → Pattern Extraction → Vectorization → Neural Network → Personalized Suggestions
```

#### 3. Continuous Improvement
- **Real-time learning**: Updates suggestions as you code
- **Usage tracking**: Weighs suggestions based on your preferences
- **Context analysis**: Considers current code context for relevance

#### 4. Learning Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bar showing AI learning advancement
- Percentage indicator of personalization level
- Pattern frequency analysis

### Learning Metrics

The system tracks several key metrics:

- **Code Patterns**: Common structures you use frequently
- **Language Preferences**: Your coding style in different languages
- **Suggestion Acceptance**: Which AI suggestions you find helpful
- **Error Patterns**: Common mistakes to help prevent future errors
